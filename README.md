## Introduction

Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to swap various ERC-20 tokens without the need for a traditional order book, providing liquidity and facilitating DeFi transactions.

## Key Concepts

### Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol known for its automated market maker (AMM) model. It allows users to trade tokens directly from their wallets, providing liquidity and earning fees in the process.

### Ethereum
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables the execution of smart contracts and the development of decentralized applications (DApps). Transactions on Ethereum involve the execution of these smart contracts and the transfer of Ether (ETH) and other tokens.

### Layer-2 Solutions
Layer-2 solutions are protocols or technologies that are built on top of Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs. Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon are examples of Layer-2 solutions that aim to enhance Ethereum's performance.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `/data`: Contains datasets related to Uniswap transactions and liquidity pools.
- `/code`: Includes code for data collection, analysis, and visualization.
- `/figures`: Figures files, including diagrams and visualizations
